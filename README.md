Automating Unity 3D Games with Appium and AltUnityRunner
Introduction: This article provides steps to set up an environment for automating tests of a Unity 3D game using Appium and AltUnityRunner. Appium allows controlling and interacting with a game installed on an Android device, while AltUnityRunner enables accessing game objects and calling methods directly from Unity code.

Prerequisites:
Unity 2019.4 or higher
Android SDK
Java Development Kit (JDK)
Python 2.7 or 3.7
Appium desktop
AltUnityRunner package
Setting up the Development Environment:
Install Python and create a virtual environment
Install Appium Python client in the virtual environment using pip
Install AltUnityRunner package in Unity and configure the Unity project
Set up an Android device or emulator for testing
Install the Unity game build on the Android device
Connecting Appium to the Device:
Start the Appium server
Define Appium capabilities for the device
Initialise the Android driver and launch the app
Accessing Unity Objects with AltUnityRunner:
Import AltUnityRunner in the test file
Get references to game objects using AltUnityRunner
Call methods on game objects or static methods
Writing the First Test:
Create a test class inheriting from unittest.TestCase
Write a sample test to tap a button using Appium
Use AltUnityRunner to verify game state changed

This covers the basic setup and an example test case to get started with automating a Unity game on Android using Appium and AltUnityRunner. Let me know if any part needs more explanation.
